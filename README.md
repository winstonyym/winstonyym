I am a PhD Researcher at the [Urban Analytics Lab, Singapore](https://ual.sg/), National University of Singapore. My research interests include urban deep learning models, open data, and open source urban analytical software. I hope to examine how urban data and computational workflows can contribute to the planning of sustainable and liveable cities.

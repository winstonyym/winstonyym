I am a final year PhD Researcher at the [Urban Analytics Lab, Singapore](https://ual.sg/), National University of Singapore. My research interests include deep learning, open data, and open source software. I hope to examine how urban data and computational workflows can contribute to the planning of sustainable and liveable cities. 

My PhD research focuses on the concept of "City as Graphs". Leveraging the relational connections in cities, graphs allow us to unlock the full potential of urban networks for more comprehensive and powerful urban predictive modelling. I developed an open source Python package [Urbanity](https://github.com/winstonyym/urbanity) to facilitate generation of city graphs from spatial boundaries for any geographical location and scale in the world. Most recently, I develop use cases to show the usefulness of urban graphs for urban policy and planning with two projects 1) multicity building energy prediction for equitable decarbonization and 2) quantifying urban health through big data in the United States.
